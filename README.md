this project is related to our mechatronics course.
my project is simulation of the puma robot .

This robot is an industrial robot.
Puma robot has many applications in the industry, such as welding, assembly and packaging, moving the product, turning, cutting and other items.

The Puma robot I considered has three revolute joints , three degrees of freedom, and a prismatic joint for the end effector..
